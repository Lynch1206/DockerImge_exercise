# DockerImage exercise
I am a fresh new Docker learner.

## Goal
Build a docker image and deploy it to train an easy GAN model. 
> This exercise is not about how good the model is.

- [ ] The purpose of the exercise is to build and deploy a docker image for python training.
- [ ] User can export the training result to the local device.


## What I have learned
1. Build a Dockerfile script.
2. Build docker image with `conda` environment and specify environment with `.yml` file.
   - Activate the environment.
3. Run the `train_gan.py` script with the environment.
4. Assign local path in train file and shell script.
